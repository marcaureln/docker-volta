[![Update Volta version](https://github.com/marcaureln/docker-volta/actions/workflows/update.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/marcaureln/docker-volta/actions/workflows/update.yml)

This repository contains Docker images for the [Volta](https://volta.sh) JavaScript tool manager.

## What is Volta?

To quote their website:

> The Hassle-Free JavaScript Tool Manager.

I can't say it better than that.

## How to use this image

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project directory with the following content:

```Dockerfile
# You can specify the version of volta you want to use by changing the tag
FROM marcaureln/volta:latest

# Make sure to have a Node.js version pinned in your package.json (use `volta pin node` to pin a version)
COPY package.json ./
COPY package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies using the pinned npm or yarn version
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your application
COPY . .

# Run your application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Then build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-nodejs-app .
```

And run it:

```bash
docker run --rm -it my-nodejs-app
```

## Image Variants

The `marcaureln/volta` images come in several flavors. `<version>` refers to the Volta version you want to use. The `latest` tag is always the latest version of Volta with the latest stable Debian version.

### `marcaureln/volta:<version>`

The tags are based off of [Debian's buildpack-deps images](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/). The following tags are available: `<version>-bookworm`, `<version>-bullseye`.

### `marcaureln/volta:<version>-slim`

The slim variant is based off of [Debian's slim images](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/). The following tags are available: `<version>-bookworm-slim`, `<version>-bullseye-slim`.

### Why is there no Alpine variant?

See <https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/473> for more information.

## Supported Volta versions

We currently support Volta versions >= `2.0.0`.

## Supported Node.js versions

All Node.js versions supported by Volta are supported by this image. Always make sure to pin a Node.js version in your `package.json` file. Learn more about pinning Node.js versions [here](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/understanding#managing-your-toolchain).
